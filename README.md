# CPR E 559 Alternative AWS GUI
An alternative AWS GUI for beginners. Made for my CPR E 559 class.

The idea is to create new keys, security groups, launch configurations, and auto scaling groups with a single push of a button.
The GUI shows how many instances are active at a given time with green boxes. This greatly reduces the complexity for beginners.
